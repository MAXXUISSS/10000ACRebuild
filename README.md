This repostory contains a prototype made by myself of a game called 10000 AC, a roguelike game with inspiration in Hades.
ItÂ´s an isometric game with a wave spawner where you have to survive to each wave, upgrading yourself with "organs" as weapons.
Ive used lerp or lineal interpolation for movement, so you move faster as you pressed the arrow in the same direction and you slowly decrease your speed when you stop pushing the button
- -Coordinated attack x enemies, designed so that after certain attack attempts, they attack and generate knockback in the Player
-Trigger-to-damage and range abilities
-Management by inspector of vision behaviors

This prototype is designed so that the client can use everything from the inspector and can modify it
